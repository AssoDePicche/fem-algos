# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need

This repository contains the algorithms and data structures that I learned when I took the "Last Algorithms Course You'll Need" taught by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen). Some of the topics covered during the classes were Big O time complexity, arrays, lists, trees, graphs, and maps, besides searching and sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, then clone this repository and install all the dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AssoDePicche/fem-algos.git

cd fem-algos/

npm install

To run the test suite use `npm tun test`.
